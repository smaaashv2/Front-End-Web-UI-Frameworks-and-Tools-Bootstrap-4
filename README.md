The repository contains all the assignments and coding for Front-End Web UI Frameworks and Tools: Bootstrap 4 course by The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

The individual assignments can be accessed through the commit log. 
However, I urge you to try to complete the assignments on your own first. They are simple and form your foundation in web-development. This repository should be used only as a reference and not a solution.
